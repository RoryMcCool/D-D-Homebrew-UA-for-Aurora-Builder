                <description> 
                    <p>Poised between the worlds of the living and the 
                    dead, dhampirs retain their grip on life yet are 
                    endlessly tested by vicious hungers. Their ties to 
                    the undead grant dhampirs a taste of a vampire’s 
                    deathless prowess in the form of increased 
                    speed, darkvision, and a life-draining bite. With 
                    unique insights into the nature of the undead, 
                    many dhampirs turn to the lives of adventurers 
                    and monster hunters. Their reasons are often 
                    deeply personal. Some seek danger, imagining 
                    monsters as personifications of their own 
                    hungers. Others pursue revenge against 
                    whatever turned them into a dhampir. And still 
                    others embrace the solitude of the hunt, striving 
                    to distance themselves from those who’d tempt 
                    their hunger.</p>

                    <h4>Dhampir Hungers</h4>
                    <p>Every dhampir knows a thirst slaked only by the 
                    living. This desire is a whisper in the mind, a 
                    tinge to the sight, a reflex constantly needing to 
                    be suppressed. Those who overindulge their 
                    thirst risk losing control and forever viewing 
                    others as prey. Those who resist might find 
                    exceptional ways of controlling their urges or 
                    suppress it through constant, molar-grinding 
                    restraint. In any case, temptation haunts 
                    dhampirs, and circumstances conspire to give 
                    them endless reasons to indulge. 
                    While many dhampirs thirst for blood, your 
                    character might otherwise gain sustenance from 
                    the living. Roll on or choose an option from the 
                    Dhampir Hungers table to determine what 
                    tempts your character to feed:</p>
                    <table>
                        <thead>

                    <h4>Dhampir Origins</h4>
                    <p>Dhampirs often arise from encounters with 
                    vampires, but all manner of macabre bargains, 
                    necromantic influences, and encounters with 
                    mysterious immortals might have transformed 
                    your character. The Dhampir Origins table 
                    provides suggestions for how your character 
                    gained their lineage:</p>
                    <table>

                        <tr><td>1</td><td>You are the reincarnation of an ancestor who was a vampiric tyrant.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>2</td><td>Your pact with a predatory deity, fiend, fey, or spirit causes you to share their hunger.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>3</td><td>You survived being attacked by a vampire but were forever changed.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>4</td><td>A parasite inhabits your body. You indulge your hunger to sate it.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>5</td><td>You loved an immortal and were willing to be transformed into a vampire to join them, but tragedy interrupted the transformation.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>6</td><td>You are a diminished manifestation of an otherworldly being. Slaking your hunger hastens your renewal.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>7</td><td>You don’t know your origins, but you were raised by vampires or other monsters.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>8</td><td>A radical experiment changed your body, making you reliant on others for vital fluids.</td></tr>

                    </ul>
                    <p>You can empower yourself with your bite a
